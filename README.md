# DeLiGAN

![alt text](http://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/deligan/GAN-DeLiGAN.svg)


  This project is an implementation of the Generative Adversarial Network proposed in our CVPR 2017 paper - [DeLiGAN : Generative Adversarial Networks for Diverse and Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02071.pdf). Via this project, we make two contributions:
   1. We propose a simple but effective modification of the GAN framework for settings where training data is diverse yet small in size. 
   2. We propose a modification of inception-score proposed by [Salimans et al](https://github.com/openai/improved-gan). Our modified inception-score provides a single, unified measure of inter-class and intra-class variety in samples generated by a GAN. 

## Dependencies

  The code for DeLiGAN is provided in Tensorflow 0.10 for the MNIST and Toy dataset, and in Theano 0.8.2 + Lasagne 0.2 for the CIFAR-10 and Sketches dataset. This code was tested on a Ubuntu 14.04 workstation hosting a NVIDIA Titan X GPU. 
  
## Datasets

  This repository includes implementations for 4 different datasets. 
   1. Toy (self generated unimodal and bimodal gaussians)
   2. MNIST (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gdahl/mnist.npz.gz)
   3. CIFAR-10 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
   4. Sketches (http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/classifysketch/)

The models for evaluating DeLiGAN on these datasets can be found in our repo. The details for how to download and lay out the datasets can be found in `src/datasets/README.md` 

## Usage

### Training DeLiGAN models

  To run any of the models
   - First download the datasets and store them in the respective sub-folder of the datasets folder (src/datasets/) 
   - To run the model on any of the datasets, go to the respective src folders and run the `dg_'dataset'.py` file in the respective dataset folders with two arguments namely, `--data_dir` and `--results_dir`. For example, starting from the top-level folder, 

    cd src/sketches 
    python dg_sketches.py --data_dir ../datasets/sketches/ --results_dir ../results/sketches

   - Note that the `results_dir` needs to have 'train' as a sub-folder.

### Modified inception score  
For example, to obtain the modified inception scores on CIFAR
   - Download the inception-v3 model (http://download.tensorflow.org/models/image/imagenet/inception-2015-12-05.tgz.) and store it in `src/modified_inception_scores/cifar10/`
   - Generate samples using the model trained in the `dg_cifar.py` and copy it to `src/modified_inception_scores/cifar10/`
   - Run `transfer_cifar10_softmax_b1.py` to transfer learn the last layer.
   - Perform the modifications detailed in the comments in `transfer_cifar10_softmax_b1.py` and re-run it to evaluate the inception scores.
   - The provided code can be modified slightly to work for sketches as well by following the comments provided in `transfer_cifar10_softmax_b1.py`
   
Parts of the code in this implementation have been borrowed from the [Improved-GAN implementation](https://github.com/openai/improved-gan) by OpenAI (T. Salimans, I. Goodfellow, W. Zaremba, V. Cheung, A. Radford, and X. Chen. Improved techniques for training gans. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 2226â€“2234, 2016.)
